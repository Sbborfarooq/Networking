Retrofit is a powerful HTTP client for Android and Java that makes it easy to consume RESTful web services.
It simplifies the process of making network requests and handling responses.

Serialization:

What it is: The process of converting a Kotlin object into JSON format.
When it happens: This occurs when you want to send data to the server (e.g., in a POST request).
Example: If you have a Kotlin object like User , Gson will convert it into a JSON string that can be sent in the request body.

val newUser  = User(id = 2, name = "Jane Doe", email = "jane.doe@example.com")
// Gson converts newUser  to JSON:
// {
//     "id": 2,
//     "name": "Jane Doe",
//     "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
// }

Deserialization:

What it is: The process of converting JSON data received from the server into a Kotlin object.
When it happens: This occurs when you make a GET request and receive a JSON response from the server.
Example: If the server responds with a JSON string representing a user, Gson will convert that JSON into a User  object.

{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

After deserialization, you get a Kotlin object:
val user = User(id = 1, name = "John Doe", email = "john.doe@example.com")
